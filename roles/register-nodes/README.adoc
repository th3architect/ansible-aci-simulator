register-nodes
==============

Overview
--------
This role walks a new ACI fabric node-by-node and registers what it finds.

It was written to quickly stand up an ACI Simulator. This can become a repetitive task, as all configuration (including fabric node registeration) is lost upon reboot of the appliance.

Role Variables
--------------
You are required to populate the variable `nodes` with a list of equipment you expect to find.

The role searches based on `serial`. You must additionally provide `id` and `name`. The node role (leaf or spine) is left undefined at this time, as the ACI Simulator correctly identifes it automatically, and in most cases is evident to the user in the name regardless.

The role defaults reflect the virtual switches included with ACI Simulator:
[source,yaml]
nodes:
  - serial: TEP-1-101
    id: 101
    name: leaf-101
  - serial: TEP-1-102
    id: 102
    name: leaf-102
  - serial: TEP-1-103
    id: 201
    name: spine-201
