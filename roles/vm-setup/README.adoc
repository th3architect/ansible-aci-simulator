Due to the use of the `vmware_guest_sendkey` module, your target vSphere environment must be running version 6.5 or higher, and your Ansible version must be 2.9 or higher.

Role Variables
--------------

`vm_dc`: The vSphere datacenter where your VM is deployed

`vm_name`: The name of your deployed VM. This is presumed unique.

`wait_time`: A value in seconds to wait for the VM to reach its initial configuration prompt

`net_cidr`: The desired IPv4 address for the APIC in CIDR format. IPv6 is not supported by this role at this time.
