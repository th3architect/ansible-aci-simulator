General Guidelines
------------------

Inventory
~~~~~~~~~
A sample inventory `sample_inventory` is provided in this repository. The roles assume this structure, so avoid changing it significantly.

HTTPS Certificate Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All roles in this project contain a default variable `validate_certs: yes`. You should override this in your inventory when working in a lab envronment that does not have a HTTPS ceritifcate installed that can be validated from your Ansible control node.
